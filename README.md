# Polar Bacteria
A simplified complete 1-level white blood cell game using polar movement and sprite rotation (takes most efficient direction of rotation toward destination angle)

In addition to polar movement which is entirely a programmer preference, this game demonstrates Kivy rotation (using PushMatrix, Rotate, then PopMatrix, which is how to rotate something in Kivy) using purely imperative (Python) code (no declarative [kv language] code).

##Known Issues:
* Missing sprites unless run from LiClipse ( Setup LiClipse such as method at http://www.expertmultimedia.com/usingpython/py3kivy-liclipse.html only way to play currently )
